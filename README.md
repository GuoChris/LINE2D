This code repository aims at real-time texture-less object instance detection and tracking. This first version was revised from OpenCV source code, which implemented the PAMI12 paper "Gradient Response Maps for Real-time Detection of Texture-less Objects".

### What is this repository for? ###

* This work improves the state of the art object instance detection methods and extends the function to object tracking and pose estimation. We pursue high detection rate and speed.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Platform: windows
* Dependencies: Opencv, freeglut, glog, protobuf
